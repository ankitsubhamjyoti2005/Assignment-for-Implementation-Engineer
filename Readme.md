# Implementation Plan: AWS + Terraform + Kubernetes Deployment

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for deploying a scalable and secure cloud-native application using AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes.

---

## ✅ Stage 1: High-Level Architecture Design

I will create a detailed architecture diagram and description that explains:

- AWS services used
- Security considerations
- Scalability strategies

This stage sets the foundation for a reliable and production-ready infrastructure.

---

## 🏗️ Stage 2: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

Using Terraform, I will:

- Provision **VPC**, **subnets**, and **security groups**
- Deploy an **EKS cluster** with **autoscaling**
- Configure **IAM roles**, **RDS**, and **S3**

This ensures repeatable and version-controlled infrastructure.

---

## ☸️ Stage 3: Kubernetes Deployment

I will write Kubernetes manifests to:

- Deploy **backend** and **frontend** services
- Configure **ConfigMaps**, **Secrets**, and **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**
- Expose services using **LoadBalancer**

This enables microservice management and scalability.

---

## 📊 Stage 4: Logging and Monitoring

To maintain observability, I will set up:

- **Centralized logging** using CloudWatch and Fluent Bit
- **Monitoring** using Prometheus, Grafana, and Kubernetes metrics
- **Alerts** via SNS and CloudWatch Alarms

This provides insights into system health and enables proactive responses.

---

## 🔄 Stage 5: External Data Integration

I will implement mechanisms to fetch and store external API data:

- Use a **Lambda function** or **Kubernetes CronJob**
- Store fetched data in **S3** or **DynamoDB**
- Secure API keys using **AWS Secrets Manager**

This stage allows integration with third-party services.

---

## 🎁 Bonus Tasks

- CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions**
- **Security hardening** (IAM roles, WAF, Secrets Manager)
- **Disaster Recovery** strategy and **scaling test**
- **Automated testing** for Terraform and infrastructure
